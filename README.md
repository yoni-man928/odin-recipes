# odin-recipes
This project is part of the odin project curriculum. It is a simple website that demonstrates my understanding of basic HTML structure, including creating and linking multiple web pages.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Writing structured HTML
- Linking pages using relative paths
- Using Git and GitHub for version control

As I progress, I will continue to enhance this project by adding CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.
